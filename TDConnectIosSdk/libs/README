This folder contains the binary packages for libcur for iOS.
curl/lib/libcurl.a contains a fat archive with the following architectures: armv7 armv7s i386 x86_64 arm64.
During development, it's convenient to use the fat archive, as it'll run both on the simulator and on iPhones 5 and above.
When submitting the app to the store, the libcurl_arm64.a should be used, as it only targets arm64.
If you want to target architectures different that arm64, you should use "lipo -remove" with libcurl.a to strip it off from unnecessary architectures.

It's also possible to build libcurl yourself. For the purpose:
1. Download libcurl source code from https://curl.haxx.se
2. Use a tool like https://github.com/sinofool/build-libcurl-ios or
https://github.com/biasedbit/curl-ios-build-scripts to build libcurl

The included binary has been built with:
https://curl.haxx.se/download/curl-7.56.1.tar.gz
using
